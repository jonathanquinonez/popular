MOBILE BANKING SECURITY

Our Mobile Banking uses the same security standard as our online banking service. 
Accounts are protected by 128-bit encryption, as they are when you access My Online Bank. 

Each time you log on you will be asked for your user name, answer a secret question and password. If you choose to remember username and devise, next time you will only have to type your password.

If you forget your password, you can change it online at www.bancopopular.com/password or by contacting our customer service representatives at TeleBanco Popular (787) 724-3655 (Puerto Rico) or 1-888-724-3655 (United States / Virgin Islands) and they will issue you a new one for you.

Always download the Android App from Google Play.
